// How the kernels split the work (one token, ncols_dst == 1):
//   - A warp is cut into lane groups of lpr lanes, lpr a power of two chosen from the row width. A lane group owns R
//     consecutive rows (twice that with a fused gate), which share every load of the activations.
//   - Each lane takes C consecutive weight blocks per iteration. They are loaded either directly with the widest loads
//     their alignment allows, or (staged) by the whole lane group with coalesced 128-bit loads into shared memory, from
//     where each lane reads its own blocks. Staging matters for 2-byte-aligned blocks (Q8_0, Q4_0), whose direct loads
//     are 32 bits wide and strided.
//   - 4-bit codes are unpacked with masks only: dp4a on (q & 0x0F0F0F0F) and an unsigned-by-signed dp4a on
//     (q & 0xF0F0F0F0), combined as (lo << 4) + hi, with the factor 1/16 moved into the activation scale.
//   - The activation block sums that the offsets and mins need (Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q4_K, Q5_K) are computed in FP32 from
//     the int8 values once per activation load and shared by all rows; block_q8_1's FP16 sum is never read, because it
//     overflows on large activations.
//   - Q4_K, Q5_K and IQ4_XS take one 256-weight super-block per lane. IQ4_XS looks its 4-bit indices up with __byte_perm
//     in a table held in registers, with the activations pre-permuted into the order the lookup produces.
//   - Q4_K is Q5_K without the fifth bit: sub-blocks 2j and 2j + 1 take the low and high nibbles of the same 8 code
//     words. The high nibbles stay in place (q & 0xF0F0F0F0, unsigned-by-signed dp4a), and the sub-block's sum, which is
//     then exactly 16 times too large, is shifted right by 4 once, instead of shifting every word.
//   - Q6_K takes one super-block per lane too, staged only: its 210-byte super-blocks are 2-byte aligned, so lanes whose
//     block starts at an odd half-word shift the words they read from shared memory by 2 bytes, rows that are only 8- or
//     4-byte aligned (K = 1024, 512) are staged with 8- or 4-byte loads, and a fused gate/up stages its two matrices one
//     after the other in the same buffer (27 KB per block instead of 54 KB). The 6-bit codes are nibbles of ql OR-ed with
//     a 2-bit field of qh, one dp4a per 4 weights, and the offset -32 comes from the activations' half-block sums,
//     shared by all rows.
//   - Q5_0's fifth bits stay where they are: a block's sum splits into sum(nibble * a) + 16 * sum(bit * a), and
//     (qh >> j) & 0x01010101 holds the fifth bits of weights j, 8 + j, 16 + j and 24 + j, so the activations are
//     regrouped the same way once per block (two 4 x 4 byte transposes), shared by all rows.
//   - Q2_0 (64 weights, an FP16 scale and 16 bytes of 2-bit codes, as Q4_0's 18 bytes) takes two blocks per lane, so
//     that chunks stay 4-byte aligned. Its codes are looked up with __byte_perm in a 4-byte table (0x020100FF: codes 0..3
//     -> -1..2) with the code word itself as the selector, 4 lookups and 3 shifts per 16 weights; the lookups return
//     weights (0, 2, 4, 6) and (1, 3, 5, 7) of each run of 8, so the activations are split into even and odd bytes once
//     per load, shared by all rows. No masks, offsets or activation sums.
//   - Tile staging (Q2_0 without a fused gate, where a lane group's segment isn't a multiple of 16 bytes, as for
//     Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's 640-wide down projection: 180-byte rows, one lane per row, 36 bytes per iteration): each
//     warp copies all its rows, which are contiguous, into dynamic shared memory once with coalesced 128-bit loads,
//     then every lane reads its chunks from there, instead of each lane loading its own row 4 bytes at a time.
//   - The grid types (IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ3_S) take one super-block per lane, staged as Q6_K. Each block
//     copies its type's grid into shared memory first; a weight's sign is applied as sum(g * u) - 2 * sum((g & m) * u)
//     with m the byte mask of the negative weights, and every scale multiplies its integer sum in FP32. The decoding of
//     IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS and IQ3_S is in mmvq-pascal-iq.cuh, free of ggml's headers so that it can be checked on a CPU.
//   - Row pointers are computed once and advanced by a constant; partial sums are reduced with warp shuffles only.
// The expert path (ids), the routed + shared expert launch (fusion.shared_up), biases and the GLU epilogue follow
// mul_mat_vec_q exactly.
//
// 2 to MMVQP_MAX_COLS tokens (ncols_dst > 1) run mul_mat_vec_q_pascal_mc, which keeps the lane groups, launch shapes
// and staging of the single-token kernel and adds a loop over the tokens inside each iteration: a lane group stages its
// weight chunks once, then loads one token's activations at a time and multiplies them by every row's chunk, so weights
// are read once per step and activations once per token, shared by all rows of the lane group.
//   - MUL_MAT: every block serves all tokens of its channel.
//   - MUL_MAT_ID: one block per (token, slot) entry of ids. The first entry of each distinct expert serves the later
//     entries that picked the same expert (up to MMVQP_MAX_COLS of them; a further entry starts a new group), and the
//     other blocks exit at once, so every distinct expert's rows are read once per step instead of once per token.
//   - The routed + shared expert launch adds one block that serves all tokens with the shared expert.
//   - GGML_CUDA_MMVQ_PASCAL_STAGE_ACT=1 also stages each token's activations through shared memory (where they fit
//     next to the weights: all types but Q4_K, Q5_K and the staged IQ4_XS shape), so that they are read with coalesced
//     loads instead of one strided load per lane and token. Off by default until it is measured on a P106.
//
// For the types of Ornith-1.5's files (mmvqp_mt_type: IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS, N2P, N3P, Q8_0, Q5_0), 2 to MMVQP_MAX_COLS tokens
// run mul_mat_vec_q_pascal_mt instead, which decodes each weight once for all tokens (GGML_CUDA_MMVQ_PASCAL_MT=0: the
// kernel above). It keeps the lane groups, launch shapes and weight staging of the single-token kernel and changes three
// things:
//   - MUL_MAT_ID: block y serves group y of the step's (token, slot) entries, the entries that picked one expert (up to
//     MMVQP_MAX_COLS of them in entry order; a further entry starts a new group). Each warp finds the groups in ids
//     itself with shuffles and ballots over at most MMVQP_MT_MAX_ENTRIES entries, one load of ids per lane, and blocks
//     past the last group exit at once; the kernel above scanned ids entry by entry in every block.
//   - The block stages its tokens' activations in shared memory once (per tile of iterations where a row's do not fit
//     the budget, GGML_CUDA_MMVQ_PASCAL_MT_ACT_KB): the int8 values in 32-byte runs with 16 bytes of padding per lane
//     chunk, so that the lanes of a quarter warp hit different banks, and the FP32 scales (and Q5_0's offset terms)
//     beside them, so one token's 32-weight sub-block is two 128-bit and one or two 32-bit shared loads. Where a row fits
//     at once, a block handles rb consecutive row blocks (GGML_CUDA_MMVQ_PASCAL_MT_RB), so the staging and the grid
//     types' tables serve more rows.
//   - Each 32-weight sub-block is decoded once into signed int8 words (mmvqp_sub_decode) and multiplied by every
//     token's activations (mmvqp_sub_isum), instead of decoding the whole chunk again per token.
// Every token's sums are formed exactly as in mul_mat_vec_q_pascal: the same integer sums, the same FP32 operations in
// the same order, so each result is bit-identical to the one-token kernel's.
